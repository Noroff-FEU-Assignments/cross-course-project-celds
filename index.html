    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">[
        First make sure you have a long, strong and secure password that will be hard for others to crack, make sure to use reliable third-party solutions, have network security that protects your data with the use of firewalls, use https instead of http because https is more secure that ecrypts the data being sent between the website and the userâ€™s browser.
